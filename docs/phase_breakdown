    se Breakdown for the Upgraded IoT Project
✅ Phase 1: Core Sensor-to-API Pipeline
ESP8266 with DHT11 reads and sends data

Flask API receives and stores it (via HTTP POST)

Data stored in PostgreSQL using SQLAlchemy

.env for secrets, API key validation

Goal: End-to-end working data flow from sensor to database.

📊 Phase 2: Web Dashboard
Build frontend using React (or Flask + HTMX if preferred)

Real-time readings + historical charts (Chart.js or Recharts)

Add filters (All / 24h / 7d), export to CSV

Goal: Functional dashboard to view and analyze data.

🚨 Phase 3: Alerting System
Threshold-based alert logic (temp > 30°C, humidity < 25%)

Integrate:

✅ Telegram bot

✅ Email alerts via SMTP

Background jobs via APScheduler or Celery (optional)

Goal: Get notified of abnormal conditions in real-time.

🔐 Phase 4: Authentication & Security
Add login system (Flask-Login or JWT)

Admin-only dashboard access

API key/JWT protection on /api/data

Goal: Secure endpoints and dashboard from unauthorized use.

🐳 Phase 5: Dockerization & DevOps
Containerize backend using Docker

Add docker-compose.yml (with PostgreSQL)

Set up NGINX reverse proxy + HTTPS (with Let's Encrypt)

GitHub Actions for CI/CD (optional)

Goal: Portable, deployable, production-ready setup.

🧠 Phase 6 (Optional): Intelligence & Prediction
Train a basic ML model for:

Predictive maintenance

Anomaly detection (unexpected sensor behavior)

Display smart insights on dashboard

Goal: Make the system proactive, not just reactive.timestamp = Column(Datetime, default=datetime.utcnow)
